Thank you for the correction. You are right to distinguish between the two games. The previous guide was for the original Super Famicom game and its direct port, *Clock Tower: The First Fear*.

You are playing the sequel, simply titled *Clock Tower* for the PS1 (also known as *Clock Tower 2* in some regions). This is a different game with different characters (Jennifer is no longer the protagonist) and a different structure.

For the PS1 *Clock Tower*, "getting all characters to survive" is a more complex goal, as the game features multiple protagonists and branching paths. The best ending is achieved by successfully completing the game as **Jennifer** and getting the **"A" ending**.

Based on a detailed walkthrough for the game , here is a step-by-step guide to achieving the best possible outcome where the maximum number of characters survive.

### 📜 Step-by-Step Guide to the Best (A) Ending

This guide follows the "Jennifer 100%" route, which aims for the A ending and the survival of 7 characters .
